## Description
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

```

**Example 3:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Approach 1: Hashing (set)
Time complexity: `O(n)`    |    Space complexity: `O(n)`
where `n` is the number of nodes

``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        curr = head
        
        visited = set()
        while curr and curr not in visited:
            visited.add(curr)
            curr = curr.next
        
        return not(curr is None)
```

## Approach 2: Fast and slow pointers
Time complexity: `O(n)`    |    Space complexity: `O(1)`
where `n` is the number of nodes

``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if fast == slow:
                return True
        
        return False
```
